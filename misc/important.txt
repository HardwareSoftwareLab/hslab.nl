In /misc/sites.txt there is a list of all the subfolders that are considered to be a site.

In order to support new banner sizes, in /misc/bna.js there is a line that looks something like:
`const supported_sizes = ["_512x128", "_128x512"];`
The new size has to be added there.
And in /misc/create_banners_json.py there is a line that looks something like `supported_sizes = ["_512x128", "_128x512"]`.
The new size should be added there as well.
You should be able to find those locations with a search for @Banner_Support_Sizes.
